# Project Description

## Overview
This project is a Java application built using Spring framework and object-oriented programming principles. It aims to provide a comprehensive solution for starting a new project in Spring. Leveraging the power of Java classes and the flexibility of Spring, this project offers a robust and extensible foundation for hosting web services.

## Features
- **Java Classes:** The project employs the object-oriented programming paradigm, utilizing Java classes to encapsulate data and behavior, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **Spring Framework:** Built on top of the Spring framework, this project harnesses the powerful features provided by Spring, such as dependency injection, inversion of control, and aspect-oriented programming.

## Installation
